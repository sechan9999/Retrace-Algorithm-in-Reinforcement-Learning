# Retrace-Algorithm-in-Reinforcement-Learning

Proposes a new off-policy multi-step RL method:
Retrace(λ)
▶ Good theoretical properties: low-variance, safe and
efficient
▶ It outperforms one-step Q-learning and existing
multi-step variants
▶ Proves the convergence of Watkins’s Q(λ) for the first
time
